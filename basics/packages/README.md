# Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package `main`.

The program is using the packages with import paths `"fmt"` and `"math/rand"`

By convention, the package name is same as the last element of the import path.\
For instance, the `"math/rand"` package compromises files that begin with the statement\
`package rand`.
